# about:blank
A simple, blank webpage. No more distractions when you open your browser. 

View the **[live page](https://blank.statik.sh)**

## Usage
By default, the page color is based on browser/OS theme, and uses #F2F2F2 for light and #262626 for dark.  

For a custom color, set the URL query parameter `color` to any HEX code, such as [https://blank.statik.sh/?color=332b00](https://blank.statik.sh/?color=332b00). For even more fun, set `color` to [`random`](https://blank.statik.sh?/color=random). 

### For new tabs
On Chrome/Edge, if you'd like to set this page as your new tab page, you'll have to use an extension. [NewTab-Redirect](https://github.com/jimschubert/newtab-redirect) works well for this. Other browsers like Firefox and Vivaldi allow you to set a URL as the new tab page. Not sure about Safari.

## Reasoning
Everytime I open a new tab or browser window, I'm faced with a collection of bookmarks. It's a simple click to distract myself by going to a time-wasting site. With this, I have to manually type something into the address bar to navigate. Hopefully it'll curb my tendencies to be distracted.  

Also, I could set the homepage to `about:blank` but that's a blank, white page, regardless of theme settings. I needed a dark page, especially at night.

## Future
Gonna keep this simple. Don't really want anything extra.
