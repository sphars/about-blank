# about:blank
A simple, blank webpage. No more distracting bookmarks when you open your browser. 

View the **[live page](https://aboutblank-page.netlify.app)**

Right now, color displayed is based on your system/browser preferences, light or dark.

## For new tabs
On Chrome/Edge, if you'd like to set this page as your new tab page, you'll have to use an extension. [NewTab-Redirect](https://github.com/jimschubert/newtab-redirect) works well for this. Other browsers like Firefox and Vivaldi allow you to set a URL as the new tab page. Not sure about Safari.

## Reasoning
Everytime I open a new tab or browser window, I'm faced with a collection of bookmarks. It's a simple click to distract myself by going to a time-wasting site. With this, I have to manually type something into the address bar to navigate. Hopefully it'll curb my tendencies to be distracted.

## Future
Gonna keep this simple. Don't really want anything extra.
